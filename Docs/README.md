# Documentation
In this folder I will share more links and information about the implementation. This felt necessary since I want to keep the main README file updated and still readable and "clean" as more content is added to the project.

# Jupyter Notebook
In an effort to get familiar with Jupyter Notebook I will create some demos of how to use the library here too.

To get started install all requirements by installing the requirements.txt file!


```bash
# Install requirements file in this folder to start jupyter.
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start jupyter and open the .ipynb file!
jupyter notebook
```
